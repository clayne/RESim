README hints for modifying Simics models.

Use project-setup --copy-device to get a copy of a module.

When doing that for ICH10, go to the modules/ICH10 and run
ln -s /eems_images/ubuntu_img/simics6/install/simics-6/simics-6.0.89/src/devices/dml-lib/usb


Add a config-user.mk file to the project directory and include:
   USER_BUILD_ID = somthing:4848
