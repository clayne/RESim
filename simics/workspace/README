README for default RESim workspace

This directory includes a number of files that may be useful within a RESim Simics workspace,
and it includes some example ini files.

The commonly used files are automatically copied to your new workspace (project) directory when
you run resim-ws.sh.  The example files are copied when you provide the "-e" falg.

The clear-linux.ini is an example RESim ini file that works with the 64-bit x86 QSP clear linux platform
that Intel includes with their free version of Simics.

The mytarget.ini is an example RESim ini file that creates and monitors a single 32-bit ubuntu system.

Also see the simics/examples/network_file_system for a more complete example.
