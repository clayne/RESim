# This script creates a new service node connected to switch0, and configures the new service
# node to link to the driver computer at 10.20.200.91 for ssh over 4022.
# Will also map port 6459 for use by drive-driver to send data to the driver.
#
# The driver's service node should be independent and able to be arbitrarily cut off, e.g., to isolate the
# simulation.
