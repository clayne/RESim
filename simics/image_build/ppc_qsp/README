README for rebuilding Simics PPC QSP kernel.
The buildall.sh script should perform a complete build,
including pulling all necessary files.

Run the script from the parent of the directory that is to
contain the buildroot directory, e.g.,
    $RESIM_DIR/simics/image_build/ppc_qsp/buildall.sh


This should build the kernel, uboot and the device tree.
Simics agent and FS were taken out of the kernel build.
