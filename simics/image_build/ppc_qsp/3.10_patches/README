Linux files for version 3.10 QSP platforms
These are the files as they are to exist in the build directory after applying the patch.
The purpose of this directory is to let us create the patch file for use in a rebuild.
For example, after the linux 3.10 is pulled into the output/build/ directory:
   cp -aR 3.10_patches /tmp/
   cp -aR linux-3.10 /tmp
   cd /tmp
   cp -aR linux-3.10 linux-3.10_patched
   cp -aR 3.10_patches/* linux-3.10_patched/
   diff -ruN linux-3.10 linux-3.10_patched > patch_file.patch

Then the patch_file copied via the qsp_buildroot.sh script so it gets
applied during the build process.
