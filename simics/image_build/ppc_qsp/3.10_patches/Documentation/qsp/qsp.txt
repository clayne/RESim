Simics QSP
==========

The QSP boards are pure virtual boards for the Wind River Simics (tm) system
simulator. They serve as demonstration/example boards. The intention is to keep the Linux port as simple and elegant as possible, while maintaining code reuse across all major architectures.

The devices on these boards are designed for simplicity first and perfomance second.
