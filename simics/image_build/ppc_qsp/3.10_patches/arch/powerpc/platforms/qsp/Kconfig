config PPC_QSP
	bool "Simics QSP for PPC"
	default n
	select QSP
	select QSP_PIC
	help
	  This option enables support for the QSP simics platform for PowerPC.

config PPC_QSP_SYNC_TIMEBASE
	bool "Manual sync of timebase between cores"
	default n
	depends on PPC_QSP && SMP
	help
	  This option enables generic code for manually syncing the timebase between cores
	  on startup for SMP systems. This is very time consuming and will not yield perfect
	  results anyway since simics runs each cores time slice in serial. When a core
	  is enabled via the sysregs it's timebase is copied from core 0 which yields a good
	  enough sync and a speedy boot so you can safely leave this option to N.
