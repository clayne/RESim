Sample files for testing RESim with Windows 7
Copy these files into the RESim workspace.
chmod 400 id_rsa
Create a param file per the wintest.ini file header.
Create a snapshot after running ahead a few minutes to give windows time to start
much of its noise.

See the simics/testing/windows for test procedures that illustrate RESim windows functions.
