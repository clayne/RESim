Example of using the Simics API to learn about linux kernel attributes.
Copy these files into a Simics workspace.
use 
   ./simics runit.simics
to load the target arm64 fvp platform.  Run it forward until it boots 
and you get the root prompt on the terminal.  Create a snapshot for 
convenience:
   write-configuration booted
Then quit Simics and restart to test your snapshot:
   ./simics -c booted

Load the test program from the simics> prompt:
    run-python-file currrentTaskArm64.py
Then use "c" to continue.  Then click into the simics root terminal
and hit a key to force a process to be scheduled so that a mode change
occurs.

Make a copy of the currentTaskArm64.py and modify it to explore other
kernel traits.  What is the address of kernel entry code?  How do you
know you entered via a syscall vs a page fault?  What does the task record
look like?   Can you record each unique task record that is loaded?
