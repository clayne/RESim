   Generate a RESim parameter file based on observiations made of a
   32 bit linux kernel.  Intended to be invoked from a shell script 
   that sets these environment variables:
       RUN_FROM_SNAP -- checkpoint of the system to run.  It is suggested
          that you let the system boot before creating the snapshot.
       RESIM_TARGET -- the name of the cell within the simulated system
          that is to be analyzed.  This is also used as the name of the
          newly generated parameter file, i.e., $RESIM_TARGET.param
